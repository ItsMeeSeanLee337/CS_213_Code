<ol>
<li>Suppose classes <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are in package <tt>ab</tt>,
and classes <tt>C</tt> and <tt>D</tt> are in package <tt>cd</tt>. Furthermore,
both <tt>C</tt> and <tt>B</tt> extend <tt>A</tt>, and <tt>D</tt> extends 
<tt>B</tt>. Assume all classes are declared to be <tt>public</tt>.
<p><ol>
<li>Are <code>protected</code> members of 
  <code>A</code> accessible in 
  <code>C</code>?&nbsp; If yes, explain how. If not, explain why.
<li>Are <code>protected</code>
  members of <code>A</code> accessible in
  <code>D</code>?&nbsp; If yes, how? If not, why?
<li>Answer the same question as in 1. replacing <tt>A</tt> with 
  <code>B</code>
<li>Answer the same question as in 2. replacing <tt>A</tt> with 
  <code>B</code>
</ol>
<hr>
<li>For each of the following pairs/groups of classes, show the most appropriate
relationship between them using UML (include multiplicities for associations).
<p>Also show code outlines for the classes involved, including fields that 
pertain to the associations between them, if any (i.e. connections that are not
super-sub or interface implementations). It doesn't matter exactly
what data structure you use for fields that are collections--that is something
that can be refined at implementation time, and does not change the UML.
(Remember, the UML is language-independent, and different languages may
offer different options of data structures.)

</li><li>You are on a project that is developing software to manage a hospital. In particular,
you are working on a sub-system that will model the patient care aspect including
doctors, patients, hospital rooms, and services for which patients are billed. Services
include medical services such as x-rays, as well as room services such as bed, TV, etc.
<p>Draw a UML class diagram of your model, with just the names of classes (fields
and methods not required), and relationships between them. Make sure to show
multiplicities on associations.
