<hr>
<ol>
<li>Write an Android app that can accept an order to make a sub.
Have checkboxes to select (or unselect) items to add (lettuce, tomato, etc.)
Have combo boxes or equivalent to 
select one out of many (exclusive)
options like the type of cheese to put in the sub.
When the user confirms
the order (via a button), display a message in a text area that lists
the sub contents. Your UI doesn't have to be pretty - just 
make it work correctly.
<p><li>This is actually a demo of an application that uses images,
and is likely to be useful for your Android app project.
<p>
The demo uses a <tt>GridView</tt> layout, 
with images in the cells. <tt>ImageView</tt> and 
<tt>ImageAdapter</tt> classes are used to lay out images, 
and have users click on them to launch an action.

<p>See the accompanying GridView.zip file for the code.</p>

<p>This should be useful base line functionality for your Android project.

<p>To import images into the drawable folder, see this at
