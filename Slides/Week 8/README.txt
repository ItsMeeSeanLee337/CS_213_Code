The code in this folder is an implementation of the outline in Slide 6
of mar6-uml.pdf: Building, Elevator, Office.

The Building.java file contains the Building class, and its inner classes
Elevator and Office.

The OfficeSpace.java file is the application that sets up a Building
with a couple of elevators and a couple of offices, and prints out the
contents of the building.
