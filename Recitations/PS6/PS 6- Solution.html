<center><h3>Access Levels, UML</h3></center>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Suppose classes <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are in package <tt>ab</tt>,
and classes <tt>C</tt> and <tt>D</tt> are in package <tt>cd</tt>. Furthermore,
both <tt>C</tt> and <tt>B</tt> extend <tt>A</tt>, and <tt>D</tt> extends 
<tt>B</tt>. Assume all classes are declared to be <tt>public</tt>.
<p><ol>
<li>Are <code>protected</code> members of 
  <code>A</code> accessible in 
  <code>C</code>?&nbsp; If yes, explain how. If not, explain why.
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>Protected members of <tt>A</tt> are <em>inherited</em> by <tt>C</tt>,
but not accessible in <tt>C</tt> via instances of <tt>A</tt>.
<p><li>Are <code>protected</code>
  members of <code>A</code> accessible in
  <code>D</code>?&nbsp; If yes, how? If not, why?
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>Protected members of <tt>A</tt> are <em>inherited</em> by <tt>D</tt>
via <tt>B</tt> (in other words, <tt>B</tt> inherits protected fields
from <tt>A</tt>, and <tt>D</tt> from <tt>B</tt>), but as with <tt>C</tt>
protected members in <tt>A</tt> are not visible in <tt>D</tt> via
instance of <tt>A</tt>.
<p><li>Answer the same question as in 1. replacing <tt>A</tt> with 
  <code>B</code>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>Protected members of <tt>B</tt> are <em>NOT</em> inherited by <tt>C</tt>,
nor are they accessible in <tt>C</tt> via instances of <tt>A</tt>, since 
<tt>C</tt> is in a different package than <tt>B</tt>, but 
does not extend <tt>B</tt>.
<p><li>Answer the same question as in 2. replacing <tt>A</tt> with 
  <code>B</code>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p><tt>D</tt> inherits protected members of <tt>B</tt> since it subclasses
from <tt>B</tt>
</ol>
<hr>
<li>For each of the following pairs/groups of classes, show the most appropriate
relationship between them using UML (include multiplicities for associations).
<p>Also show code outlines for the classes involved, including fields that 
pertain to the associations between them, if any (i.e. connections that are not
super-sub or interface implementations). It doesn't matter exactly
what data structure you use for fields that are collections--that is something
that can be refined at implementation time, and does not change the UML.
(Remember, the UML is language-independent, and different languages may
offer different options of data structures.)
<p></p><ol>
<li><tt>Document</tt>-<tt>Keyword</tt> in a search engine
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
        
<p><pre>
                 *   Contains >>  *
        Document ------------------ Keyword
</pre>
This is a bidirectional relationship, i.e. a document can get at all the
keywords in it, and a keyword can get at all the doocuments that contain it.
<pre>
   public class Document { 
      List&lt;Keyword> keywords;  // keywords in this document, could be null
      ...
   }
   public class Keyword { 
      List&lt;Document> documents;  // documents that contain this keyword, could be null
      ...
   }
</pre>
<p><li><tt>Friend-Friend</tt> on Facebook
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p><pre>
           -------
          |      |
         *|      |
       Friend ----
              *
</pre>
<pre>
   public class Friend {
      List&lt;Friend> friends;   // could be null
      ...
   }
</pre>
<p><li><tt>Book-Chapter</tt>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p><pre>
                      1..*
         Book <>---------- Chapter   (Composition, diamond on Book should be shaded)
</pre>
Note: Multiplicity is not required on the Book side
since by definition of a composition, a Chapter can only be in 1 book
<pre>
   public class Book {

      public class Chapter {
         ...
      }

      List<Chapter> chapters;   // must have at least one item, will be enforced 
      ...                       // in any logic that accesses chapters
   }
</pre>
Note: <tt>Chapter</tt> is an inner class because a chapter is only defined in
the context of a book, and is non-static because you can't create a <tt>Chapter</tt>
instance without having a <tt>Book</tt> instance to contain it. In other words, there
are no free-standing chapters. So, for instance, you might do something like this:
<pre>
   Book book = new Book();
   Book.Chapter chapter = book.new Chapter();
</pre>

<p><li><tt>Parking Lot-Car</tt>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<pre>
                      1        *
         ParkingLot <>---------- Car (Aggregation that is NOT a composition, diamond not shaded)
</pre>
Note: This is an aggregation since a parking lot contains cars. 
However, it is not a composition - if the parking lot goes away, the cars
will continue to exist. In other words, the existence of a car does not
depend on the lot in which it is parked.
<pre>
    public class ParkingLot {
       List&lt;Car> cars;
       ...
    }
    public class Car { 
       ParkingLot lot;   // single lot at which this car is parked, could be null
       ...
    }
</pre>
</ol>
<p></p><hr>
</li><li>You are on a project that is developing software to manage a hospital. In particular,
you are working on a sub-system that will model the patient care aspect including
doctors, patients, hospital rooms, and services for which patients are billed. Services
include medical services such as x-rays, as well as room services such as bed, TV, etc.
<p>Draw a UML class diagram of your model, with just the names of classes (fields
and methods not required), and relationships between them. Make sure to show
multiplicities on associations.
</p></li>
<p><b>SOLUTION</b> - See attached UML.
<p>(Some small changes may have been made in recitation, especially
  with multiplicities, so treat this as a starting solution...)
