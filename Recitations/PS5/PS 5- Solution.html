<ol>
<li>Inner Classes
<ol>
<li>Write a class named <tt>Outer</tt> that contains an inner class
  named Inner. Add a method to 
<tt>Outer</tt> that 
returns an object of type <tt>Inner</tt>. 
<tt>Outer</tt> has a private <tt>String</tt> field (initialized by the
constructor), 
and <tt>Inner</tt> has a <tt>toString()</tt> that displays this
field. In 
<tt>main()</tt>, create and initialize a 
reference to an <tt>Inner</tt> and display it.
<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
<pre>
public class Outer {

   private String str;
	
   public Outer(String s) { str = s; }
	
   public Inner inner() { return new Inner(); }
	
   public class Inner {
      public String toString() { return str; }
   }
	
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Outer o = new Outer("This is a private string field!!!");
      Outer.Inner i = o.inner();
      System.out.println(i);
   }
}

</pre>    
<p><li>Write a class named <tt>Outer2</tt> that contains an inner
    class named 
<tt>Inner</tt>, and the <tt>Outer2</tt> class 
itself has a method that returns an instance of the inner class. In a
separate class named 
<tt>InnerApp</tt>, make an instance of the inner class without
creating an object of the outer 
class.

<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
<pre>
public class Outer2 {

   private String str;
	
   public Outer2(String s) { str = s; }
	
   public String toString() { return str; }
	
   public Inner inner(String s) { return new Inner(s); }
	
   public static class Inner {

      String innerStr;
		
      public Inner(String s) { innerStr = s; }
		
      public String toString() { return innerStr; }
	
      public static void main(String[] args) {
  	 Outer2 o = new Outer2("Outer class string");
	 System.out.println(o);
	 Outer2.Inner i = o.inner("Inner class string");
	 System.out.println(i);
      }
   }
}

public class InnerApp {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Outer2.Inner i = new Outer2.Inner("Test Inner Class");
      System.out.println(i);
   }
}

<li>Abstract Classes. 
<p>For each of the following, tell whether the code will compile.
If not, explain why.
<ol>
<li>
<pre>
  public abstract class X { }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>Yes.
<li>
<pre>
  public class X {
     public abstract void stuff();
  }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>No. Since the class has an abstract method, the header should have the <tt>abstract</tt>
keyword. 
<li>
<pre>
  public abstract class X {
     public abstract void stuff() { 
        System.out.println("abstract");
     }
  }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>No. An abstract method cannot have a body.
<li>
<pre>
  public abstract class X {
     public void stuff() { 
        System.out.println("go figure");
     }
  }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>Yes.
<li>
<pre>
  public abstract class X {
     public abstract void stuff();
  }
  public class Y extends X { }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>No. <tt>If Y</tt> is not abstract, it must override 
the inherited method <tt>stuff</tt> with an implemented body. (Otherwise, <tt>Y</tt>
should be declared as <tt>abstract</tt>.)
<li>
<pre>
  public interface I {
     void stuff();
  }
  public abstract class X {
     public abstract void stuff();
  }

  public class Y extends X implements I { 
     public void stuff() { }
  }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>Yes.
<li>
<pre>
  public abstract class X {
     private int i,j;
     public void stuff1() { }
     public void stuff2() { }
  }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>Yes.
<li>
<pre>
  public abstract class C {
     public void write() {
        System.out.println("C");
     }
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        C c = new C().write();
     }
  }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>No. <tt>C</tt> is an abstract class, cannot be instantiated.
<li>
<pre>
  public abstract class C {
     public abstract void write();
  }
  public class D extends C {
     public void write() {
        System.out.println("D");
     }
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        C c = new D();
        c.write();
     }
  }
</pre>
<p><b>ANSWER</b>
<p>Yes. 
</ol>
<hr>
<li>
<p>
          There is an application that defines a <tt>Person</tt> class
              and a <tt>Student</tt> class. The <tt>Student</tt> class is
              defined as a subclass of <tt>Person</tt>.
              Every person has a home address,
              while every student has a school address as well. </p>

        <p>Consider printing addresses of all people in the application, assuming there is
a single array list that stores all <tt>Person</tt> and <tt>Student</tt> objects. How would
the address that is printed for students depend on the way the <tt>Student</tt>
class address methods are designed/implemented? What alternatives in design can you
think of, and what are the pros and cons of these alternatives in printing the
addresses?
<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
</p><p>Every <code>Person</code> is expected to have one default home address, but 
<code>Student</code> can have another address for school. 

</p><p>There are two ways to think about this.

</p><ul>
<li>One way is to think purely from the <font color="red">polymorphism</font>
point of view. 

<p>Suppose you were to set up a mixed collection of 
<code>Person</code> and <code>Student</code> objects like this:
<pre>
   List&ltPerson> persons = new ArrayList&lt;Person>;
   ...  // populate persons with Person and Student objects
</pre>

<p>Then, if you were to run a loop through this collection to
print address, you would statically 
type the stepping reference as <code>Person</code>, say like this:

<pre>   
   for (Person p: persons) {
      System.out.println(p.getAddress());
   }
</some></pre>

This means, you want to look at every entity, including a <code>Student</code>, as
a <code>Person</code>, 
which then implies that all addresses printed should be home
addresses. 
If you take this point of view, then the <code>Student</code> class should <em>not</em>
override 
the inherited <code>getAddress</code> method from <code>Person</code>, and should have a new
<code>getSchoolAddress</code> method.

<p></p></li><li>The other way to think about this is from the point of view of class
design independent of how applications might use objects at run time.
In this case, the method <code>getAddress</code> for a <code>Student</code> would 
override the inherited-from-<code>Person</code> implementation 
to return the school address instead. And a new
<code>getHomeAddress</code> method would
be coded to return the home address. 
</li></ul>
<hr>
<li>This problem gives an example where polymorphism is useful. 
      
Consider the class hierarchy given below :
<blockquote>
<pre>public abstract class Shape implements Comparable&lt;Shape&gt; {

    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Shape");
    }

    public abstract double getArea();

    public static final Shape biggest(Shape[] s)  {
        /** TO BE COMPLETED BY YOU **/
    }

    ... // OTHER METHODS/FIELDS YOU MAY NEED TO ADD TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    public Circle(double r) {
        radius = r;
    }
    
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Circle");
    }

    public double getArea() {
        return Math.PI*radius*radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {

    double height;
    double length;

    public Rectangle(double l,double h) {
        length = l;
        height = h;
    }
    
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Rectangle");
    }

    public double getArea() {
        return length*height;
    }
}

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape[] s = new Shape[3];

        s[0] = new Circle(7);
        s[1] = new Rectangle(5,10);
        s[2] = new Circle(4);

        System.out.println("The biggest area of all shapes is : "+Shape.biggest(s));        
        return;        
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Complete the method
<pre>    public static Shape biggest(Shape[] s)
</pre>

in the <code>Shape</code> class. This method should return the shape with
            the largest area. Note that <code>Shape</code> implements the
            <code>Comparable</code> interface.  Different
	                <code>Shape</code>s should be compared using their area.
			        
			        Now if we extend the Shape hierarchy to include more shapes, say
			        rhombus, then will your method run without any problems?
<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
</p><pre>    public static final Shape biggest(Shape[] s) {
        if (s.length == 0) { return null; }
        Shape biggestShape = s[0];
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; s.length; i++) {
            if (biggestShape.compareTo(s[i]) &lt; 0) {
                biggestShape = s[i];
            }
        }
        return biggestShape;
    }
    
    public int compareTo(Shape s) {
        double areaDifference = getArea() - s.getArea();
        if (areaDifference == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        return areaDifference &lt; 0 ? -1 : 1;
    }
</pre>
</ol>
