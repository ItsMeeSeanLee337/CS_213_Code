<center><h2>Problem Set 12 (Last One!)</h2></center>
<center><h3>Streams</h3></center>
<hr>
For the stream exercises that follow the objective is to write code to process data
using streams and stream operations exclusively. Problems #5 through #7
require using the <tt>collect</tt> method which will be covered
extensively in the video to be posted next Monday (Dec 6).
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Write a method that given an array of integers, prints all odd numbers in the
array in sorted order.
<pre>
   public static void sortedOdds(int[] arr) {
      // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
   }
</pre>
<hr>
<li>Write a method to return the common items in two integer lists:
<pre>
   public static int[] getCommon(List&lt;Integer> l1, List&lt;Integer> l2) {
      // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
   }
</pre>
<hr>
<li>Pythagorean triples are any three positive integers a, b, c for which a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>

<p>Write a method to print all Pythagorean triples for which a and b are within a 
given limit:
<pre>
   // prints all pythagorean triples a,b,c where a and b are <= limit
   // each triple should be printed as "a,b,c"
   public static void printPythagoreans(int limit) {
      // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
   }
</pre>
<hr>
<li>Write a method to generate fibonacci numbers upto a limit. The first two 
fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1. So if the limit is 10, the numbers generated
will be [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] (Hint: use a 2-item array to store
a pair of consecutive fibonacci numbers, and iterate on such 2-item
arrays to do the progression)
<pre>
   public static int[] fibs(int limit) {
      // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
   }
</pre>
<hr>
<li>Write a method to partition the integers from 2 to some parameter <tt>n</tt> into 
primes and non-primes. You may implement support methods as needed.
<pre>
   public static Map&lt;Boolean, List&lt;Integer>>
   primesAndNot(int n) {
      // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
   }
</pre>
<hr>
<li>Write a method to classify words in a file according to length:
<pre>
    public static Map&lt;Integer,List&lt;String>> wordsByLength(String file) 
    throws IOException {
       // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
    }
</pre>
<hr>
<li>There are several parts to this question, which are all about hackathons. 

<p>A hackathon tracking site keeps info on all school hackathons as follows:
<pre>
public class Hackathon {
   private String school;
   private int year;
   private int month;   // 1..12 
   private int points;       // awarded by site, out of 1000
   private int participants; 
   private int sponsorship;  // $$ value

   // assume getter methods for the instance fields
   // i.e. getSchool(), getYear(), etc.
   ...

   public String toString() { return school; }
}
</pre>

<p>A school may hold more than one hackathon in a year (Rutgers USACS holds two per
year).

<p>Assume that all hackathons are stored in a <tt>List&lt;Hackathon></tt> instance called
<tt>hackathons</tt>.

<p>For each of the following questions, use streams to get the required result. 
<font color="red">Assign the result to a typed and named variable</font>. 

<p>You may assume 
that all the required classes and methods have been imported so you can use them without
qualifiers.

<p>Some of the questions may have alternative answers to the ones
given here - with streams there is often more than one way to solve a problem.

<ol>
<li>How many hackathons were held in 2021?
<li>What was the highest sponsorship amount for any hackathon?
<li>Which school (name any one) had the largest number of participants in any
hackathon in 2021?
<li>For each year, get the number of schools that hosted hackathons with > 500 participants
in that year
<li>Modify the result of the previous problem to name all the schools instead of the
count, sorted in decreasing order of participants. (A school should appear
only once in a year even if it hosted multiple hackathons that year that had > 500
participants.)
</ol>
