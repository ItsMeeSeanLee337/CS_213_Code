<hr>
<ol>
<li>Draw a state diagram that models a user's shopping session at amazon.com, 
starting with a 
search. Show the UML for an implementation using the state design
pattern including key fields and headers for the methods in the states.

<hr>
<li>Show how you would enhance the Singleton pattern to allow up to a maximum number 
of instances of an object. There should be a way for clients to recycle instances, i.e. 
when a client is finished with an instance, it gives it up, and this instance can be 
later dealt out in response to a new instance request. 

<hr>
<p><li>Say you design a <code>BinaryTree</code> class. How will you use the
<code>Iterator</code> design pattern to implement preorder, inorder, and
postorder traversals, each of which just prints the data stored at each
node? Sketch your design, and show how a client can call on the
different traversals.

<hr>
  <li>
    You are asked to implement an application that can plot graphs of
    mathematical
    functions, each function being of the form y = f(x). While there
    may be a choice
    of functions that can be plotted, only one function is plotted at
    a time on a
    given 2-D screen.
    How would you use the <tt>Template Method</tt> design pattern to
    build
    your code? Write the outline of each class in your design,
    including relevant
    fields, constructors, and methods - pick any two specific
    mathematical functions
    to demonstrate the pattern.
