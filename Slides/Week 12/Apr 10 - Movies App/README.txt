Building a Movies App
---------------------

This folder has all the ingredients you will need to build a Movies app
as described in the apr10-Movies.pdf.

To build the app following the PDF slides:
1. Download and unzip the Movies.zip starter code version. This will expand
the project into a folder called Movies
2. Fire up Android Studio and "Open" the app at folder Movies

The Movies app will now synchronize with Slide 2 of the PDF

3. Follow the slides in the PDF to build the complete app. You will
need to use the uploaded files add_edit_movie.xml, the plus icon, add_menu.xml, and
movies.dat at various places. Plus copy+paste Java code from the PDF into your
app as directed in the slides.

The file Movies.zip (complete implementation) is the finished app, in case you
run into trouble while building the app out of the PDF.

Enjoy!
