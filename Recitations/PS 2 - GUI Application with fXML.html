<center><h3>GUI Application with FXML</h3></center>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Write an application that can accept an order to make a sub, out
of three constituents: meat, cheese, and toppings. (There aren't any
choices of bread.)

<p>Use checkboxes to select (or unselect) kinds of meat (e.g. turkey,
  ham, roast beef, etc.), and kinds of toppings (e.g. lettuce, tomato,
  olives, etc.)

<p>Use a combo box to select one kind of cheese out of at least 3
options (e.g. swiss, american, provolone, etc.)

<p>When the user confirms the order (via a button), display a message
in a textarea (non-editable), listing the ingredients that went into the sub. 

<p>Make a package for the view (fxml + controller), and another package
for the main app driver code.
