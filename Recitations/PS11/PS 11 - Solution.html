<li>
Use threads to implement a stop watch that displays, 
<em>once every five seconds</em>, the minutes and seconds that have passed since it was started.
The display should be in the form <code>mm:ss</code> for minutes and seconds.
When the clock reaches 15 minutes, it should wrap back and start at 0 minutes 
and 0 seconds. The user should be able to stop the watch at any time. Write the complete
code for the application. (Not the most accurate stop watch, but the
model is useful for animations in which slight inaccuracies in time
would not be detrimental.)

<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
<ul>
<li>Version 1: StopWatch.java (attached separately)
<li>Version 2: stopwatch.zip (attached separately)
</ul>

<li>Suppose you use a search engine to search for a word or phrase
that results in a match with a large number (hundreds) of web
pages. However, the browser will only display a list of n (some
variable parameter) page links in one screenful. Implement a
multi-threaded program with one thread for the browser display, and
another for the search engine, and have the search engine deal out
hits in batches of the max size the browser can display in one
screenful. You may assume that a method called fetch has already been
written in the search engine to fetch the next batch of hits, returned
as a list of URL strings.
<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
<pre>
public class Searcher implements Runnable {
      private Request req;   // search request
      private Buffer buf;    // to store hits for display
      public Searcher(Request req, Buffer buf) {
         this.req = req;
         this.buf = buf;
         new Thread(this).start();
      }
      public void run() {
         while (true) {
            while ((List hits = fetchNext(req)) != null)  { // more
      results from fetch
               buf.put(hits);
         }
      }
   }

   public class Displayer implements Runnable {
      private Buffer buf;
      public Displayer(Buffer buf) {
         this.buf = buf;
         new Thread(this).start();
      }
      public void run() {
         while (true) {
            display(buf.get());
         }
      }
   }

   public class Buffer {
      List hits;
      boolean available = false;
      public synchronized void put(List hits) {
         while (available) {
            try {
                wait();
            }
            catch (Exception e) { }
         }
         available = true;
         this.hits = hits;
         notifyAll();
      }

      public synchronized List get() {
         while (!available) {
            try {
                wait();
            }
         catch (Exception e) { }
      }
      available = false;
      notifyAll();
      return hits;
   }

<li>In class, you saw 
the <code>Iterator</code> design pattern applied to iterate over
a linked list. That implementation did not support the <code>remove</code>
operation. Now suppose you were to update the iterator by 
supporting <code>remove</code>, which deletes the current node from the
target linked list.

<p>Explain why this new iterator is not thread-safe.
(Thread-safe means multiple threads can be run through
all methods of the class via a shared instance of the class, without
unsafe interference.) How would you change the implementation to make it safe? 
Describe your solution, no code needed.
</li>

<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
<p>
The iterator wouldn't be thread safe. Since access to remove isn't synchronized,
the remove might lead to incorrect results. For example, suppose the first
node is to be deleted by two successive threads. If the linked list was
this to start with:
<pre>
   3 -> 4 -> 1
</pre>
After the successive first node deletes, one per thread, the final list should
be:
<pre>
  1
</pre>
Now consider code to delete the first node:
<pre>
   front = front.next;
</pre>
And consider this particular sequence of interleaved actions between the two threads,
T1 and T2:
<pre>
Thread         Action
---------------------
T1             gets front.next (say address is A, for the second node (4) in the example list)
T2             gets front.next (A)
T1             front = A 
T2             front = A
</pre>
The resulting linked list would be <tt>4 -> 1</tt> instead of the expected <tt>1</tt>.
So the method would have to be
synchronized to enforce strict sequentiality between threads.
The other methods (<tt>next</tt>, <tt>hasNext</tt>)
should not be synchronized since they don't update the list structure.
