<li>
Use threads to implement a stop watch that displays, 
<em>once every five seconds</em>, the minutes and seconds that have passed since it was started.
The display should be in the form <code>mm:ss</code> for minutes and seconds.
When the clock reaches 15 minutes, it should wrap back and start at 0 minutes 
and 0 seconds. The user should be able to stop the watch at any time. Write the complete
code for the application. (Not the most accurate stop watch, but the
model is useful for animations in which slight inaccuracies in time
would not be detrimental.)
<hr>
<li>Suppose you use a search engine to search for a word or phrase
that results in a match with a large number (hundreds) of web
pages. However, the browser will only display a list of n (some
variable parameter) page links in one screenful. Implement a
multi-threaded program with one thread for the browser display, and
another for the search engine, and have the search engine deal out
hits in batches of the max size the browser can display in one
screenful. You may assume that a method called fetch has already been
written in the search engine to fetch the next batch of hits, returned
as a list of URL strings.
<hr>
<li>Earlier (Week 10, nov8-patterns.pdf), you saw the <code>Iterator</code> design
pattern applied to iterate over a linked list.
That implementation did not support the <code>remove</code>
operation. Now suppose you were to update the iterator by 
supporting <code>remove</code>, which deletes the current node from the
target linked list.

<p>Explain why this new iterator is not thread-safe.
(Thread-safe means multiple threads can be run through
all methods of the class via a shared instance of the class, without
unsafe interference.) How would you change the implementation to make it safe? 
Describe your solution, no code needed.
